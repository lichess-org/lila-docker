# lila-docker

Lichess development environment using Docker Compose, for developing on Mac, Linux, or Windows (via WSL).

The only requirements for running on your local machine are `git` and Docker Desktop. All the other dependencies (Scala, MongoDB, Node.js, etc) are installed and run in Docker containers.

## Running in Gitpod

As an alternative to running it on your local machine, you can use Gitpod (a free, online, VS Code-like IDE) for contributing. With a single click, it will launch a workspace and automatically:

-   Clone the necessary Lichess repositories
-   Install all the dependencies
-   Seed your database with test data
-   Start your development site

Click here to create a workspace:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/lichess-org/lila-docker)

## Instructions

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and have it running

1. Clone this repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lichess-org/lila-docker
    ```

1. Start the services

    ```bash
    cd lila-docker
    ./lila-docker start
    ```

    Starting new services may take 5-10 minutes. Some services will start before others and you may see errors in the logs until everything comes online.

    Lila will be the last service to complete, at which point you can visit http://localhost:8080/ to see the site.

### Stopping

To stop the containers, for later resuming via `./lila-docker start`:

```bash
./lila-docker stop
```

To remove the containers:

```bash
./lila-docker down
```

## URLs

## Usage

### Scala development:

To restart lila (after making changes to any Scala code):

```bash
./lila-docker lila restart
```

### UI (JS/CSS) development:

To watch for Typescript/SCSS changes and automatically recompile:

```bash
./lila-docker ui
```

### Updating Routes

If you edit the `conf/routes` file, you'll need to update the route cache.

```bash
docker compose exec lila ./lila playRoutes
```

### To add translation keys:

After modifying a `translation/source/*.xml` file, run:

```bash
docker compose run --rm ui /lila/bin/trans-dump
```

### Code formatting:

```bash
./lila-docker format
```

### Optional: Make the database persistent

```bash
docker compose cp mongodb:/data/db ./database
```

Then in `docker-compose.yml`add `- ./database:/data/db` to mongodb volumes

### Berserk (Python library):

To install the development version of [Berserk](https://github.com/lichess-org/berserk) and run a sample script against your local development site:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -w /berserk python \
    bash -c "pip install -e . && python /scripts/berserk-example.py"
```

### Scala Metals (IDE helper):

1. In VS Code, open this `lila-docker` project and install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Cmd+Shift+P > "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"
3. A new VS Code window will open, attached to the container instead of your host machine
4. File > Open Folder > "/workspaces/lila-docker/repos/lila" (or whichever Scala project you want to work on)
5. Install + Enable the Scala Metals extension (Cmd+Shift+X > "Scala (Metals)")
6. Cmd+Shift+P > "Metals: Import build"

Once the build has been imported, you should have code completion, go to definition, etc when you open a Scala file.

### Scalachess:

If you're making changes to the Scalachess library, you can have lila use it instead of the published Maven version:

1. Update the `build.sbt` file in the scalachess repo:

    ```diff
    -  ThisBuild / version           := "15.6.7"
    +  ThisBuild / version           := "my-test-1"  # give it a custom version
    ```

2. Update the `Dependencies.scala` file in the lila repo:

    ```diff
    -  val chess = "org.lichess" %% "scalachess" % "15.6.7"
    +  val chess = "org.lichess" %% "scalachess" % "my-test-1"
    ```

3. Publish the local scalachess changes and restart lila:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec -w /scalachess lila sbt publishLocal
    docker compose restart lila
    ```

Other Scalachess commands:

```bash
## formatting
docker compose run --rm -w /scalachess --entrypoint="sbt check" lila
docker compose run --rm -w /scalachess --entrypoint="sbt prepare" lila

## compile
docker compose run --rm -w /scalachess --entrypoint="sbt compile" lila

## test
docker compose run --rm -w /scalachess --entrypoint="sbt testKit/test" lila

## package
docker compose run --rm -w /scalachess --entrypoint="sbt package" lila
```

### Dartchess:

```bash
## run formatter
docker compose run --rm -w /dartchess mobile dart format .

## analyze
docker compose run --rm -w /dartchess mobile bash -c "dart pub get && dart analyze"

## run tests
docker compose run --rm -w /dartchess mobile bash -c "dart pub get && dart test -x full_perft"
```

### Developing Chessground locally

By default, your local lila instance will use the version of chessground that is published to npm. If you want to make changes to that library and see them reflected in your local lila instance, you can do the following:

1. Update the `package.json` in the `lila` repo:

    ```diff
    "dependencies": {
    -  "chessground": "^8.3.11",
    +  "chessground": "link:/chessground",
    }
    ```

2. Start the chessground compiler in watch mode:

    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm -w /chessground ui bash -c "pnpm install && pnpm run compile --watch"
    ```

3. Start the lila ui build in watch mode:

    ```bash
    ./lila-docker ui
    ```

Then you can see the updated chessground demo at http://localhost:8090/demo.html and when you refresh lila, it will use the local copy of chessground.

### Developing PGN Viewer locally

To re-compile the PGN Viewer after making changes:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -w /pgn-viewer ui bash -c "pnpm run sass-dev && pnpm run bundle-dev"
```

See the changes on the PGN Viewer demo page: http://localhost:8091/

### InfluxDB Monitoring

To view the InfluxDB monitoring dashboard, start your environment with the `Monitoring` service enabled and then visit http://localhost:8086/ (admin/password)

You can also see all the metrics logged by running:

```bash
curl --get http://localhost:8086/query \
    --header "Authorization: Token secret" \
    --data-urlencode "db=kamon"  \
    --data-urlencode "q=show measurements;"
```

### Mobile

1. On your Android phone:
    1. Connect your phone to the same wifi network as your host machine
    2. Enable Developer Mode
    3. In Developer Options, enable Wireless Debugging and tap into its menu
2. On your host machine:

    1. Have the lila-docker services running, with the `Mobile` optional service started
    2. Configure lila to run with your host's IP address or hostname instead of localhost

        ```bash
        ./lila-docker hostname
        ```

        - Then verify that your phone can access the site at `http://[your-selection]:8080`

    3. Connect to your phone

        ```bash
        ./lila-docker mobile
        ```

    4. Get a shell on the container:

        ```bash
        docker compose exec -it mobile bash

        # verify your phone is listed
        adb devices
        ```

    5. Install the app dependencies:
        ```bash
        flutter pub get
        dart run build_runner build
        ```
    6. Run the app:
        ```bash
        flutter run -v \
            --dart-define LICHESS_HOST=$LILA_URL \
            --dart-define LICHESS_WS_HOST=$LILA_URL
        ```
        - No substitutions necessary. The `$LILA_URL` environment variable will already be set on the container.
        - First time you run it, it might take a while
