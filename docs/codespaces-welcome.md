# Welcome to Lila in Codespaces

In the Terminal panel below, the command `./lila-docker start` will automatically run.

Follow the prompts to determine which services you want to start.

## Quick vs Advanced

You can choose between a "Quick" setup or an "Advanced" setup.

**Quick** is good if you want to use it to test out some functionality or to use as an endpoint when developing a client (mobile app, bot, or API client).

If you plan to contribute changes to the Lichess codebase, you will need **Advanced** and it will install lila from source.
